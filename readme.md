# Issue: Implement Robust Username Generation and Validation for Enhanced User Management            

## Description:
This section of the project implements robust username management features designed to enhance user experience and ensure data integrity. The implementation supports the automatic generation of unique, URL-safe nicknames for users during creation while allowing users to change their nicknames with validation. It enforces strict uniqueness and format constraints, ensuring compatibility with public-facing identifiers. This functionality improves user anonymity and privacy by assigning meaningful, anonymous nicknames based on a combination of words and numbers.            

## Features:
1. Username Generation:          

- Randomly generate nicknames upon user creation.              
- Use a combination of nouns, verbs, and a numeric suffix to ensure meaningful and diverse names.                  

2. Nickname Uniqueness:              
- Validate that no two users share the same nickname.               
- Handle duplicate nickname conflicts during both user creation and updates.
                    
3. URL-Safe Identifier:                  
- Ensure that nicknames are URL-safe, allowing them to be used in public contexts without encoding issues.                      
- Only allow alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens in nicknames.
                          
4. User-Controlled Updates:               
- Allow users to update their nicknames, ensuring the new nickname is both valid and unique.           

5. Privacy and Anonymity:                        
- Assign anonymous nicknames by default to protect user identities.          
- Maintain privacy by validating nicknames against strict rules.          

6. Testing and Verification:                       
- The system includes comprehensive tests to ensure correctness, with plans for additional tests to cover edge cases and rare scenarios.          

## Expected Outcome                
- Users will always have unique nicknames, either system-generated or user-updated.                        
- Nicknames will be compliant with URL-safety standards, ensuring seamless usage in public links.                     
- Conflicts arising from duplicate nicknames during creation or updates will be handled gracefully.                    
- User privacy and anonymity will be safeguarded through anonymous nickname assignments.                       

## Resolution Steps

1. # Routes (user_routes.py)      
## Title:               
Define the Search and Filtering Endpoint.           

## Description:        
This section adds a new /users endpoint in the user_routes.py file. The endpoint accepts query parameters to filter users based on specified criteria.                

## Expected outcome:          
The /users endpoint should:              
1. Accept query parameters like username, email, role, account_status, and date range.                  
2. Return filtered results as a paginated response.            

## Resolution Steps:        
- Added the /users endpoint with the necessary query parameters.            
- Integrated the UserService.search_and_filter_users method for filtering.         
- Included generate_pagination_links to support paginated responses.         

Purpose: Define the API endpoint for search and filtering functionality.        

```python 
@router.get("/users", response_model=UserListResponse, tags=["User Management Requires (Admin or Manager Roles)"])
async def search_users(
    request: Request,
    username: Optional[str] = None,
    email: Optional[str] = None,
    role: Optional[str] = None,
    account_status: Optional[bool] = None,
    registration_date_start: Optional[datetime] = None,
    registration_date_end: Optional[datetime] = None,
    skip: int = 0,
    limit: int = 10,
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: dict = Depends(require_role(["ADMIN", "MANAGER"]))
):
    """
    Endpoint to search and filter users based on various criteria.
    """
    filters = {
        "username": username,
        "email": email,
        "role": role,
        "account_status": account_status,
        "registration_date_start": registration_date_start,
        "registration_date_end": registration_date_end,
    }
    users, total_users = await UserService.search_and_filter_users(db, filters, skip, limit)
    user_responses = [UserResponse.model_validate(user) for user in users]
    pagination_links = generate_pagination_links(request, skip, limit, total_users)

    return UserListResponse(
        items=user_responses,
        total=total_users,
        page=skip // limit + 1,
        size=len(user_responses),
        links=pagination_links
    )
```
## Tests:      
Covered by API tests in tests/test_api/test_users_api.py.



2. # Service Layer (user_service.py)
## Title:       
Implement Filtering Logic.         

## Description         
This section defines the logic for filtering users based on criteria provided via the API. It interacts with the database and applies filters dynamically.           

## Expected Outcome          
The UserService.search_and_filter_users method should:

1. Apply all filters, including username, email, role, account status, and date range.             
2. Return paginated results along with the total count of users.            

## Resolution Steps          
- Implemented dynamic filtering using SQLAlchemy's query-building capabilities.               
- Added support for pagination using offset and limit.           
- Handled edge cases, such as missing or invalid filter values.           

Purpose: Add the logic to perform filtering and querying of users from the database.          

```python
@staticmethod
async def search_and_filter_users(
    session: AsyncSession, 
    filters: Dict[str, Optional[str]], 
    skip: int, 
    limit: int
) -> Tuple[List[User], int]:
    """
    Search and filter users based on the given criteria.
    """
    query = select(User)

    # Apply filters
    if filters.get("username"):
        query = query.filter(User.nickname.ilike(f"%{filters['username']}%"))
    if filters.get("email"):
        query = query.filter(User.email.ilike(f"%{filters['email']}%"))
    if filters.get("role"):
        query = query.filter(User.role == filters["role"])
    if filters.get("account_status") is not None:
        query = query.filter(User.email_verified == filters["account_status"])
    if filters.get("registration_date_start") and filters.get("registration_date_end"):
        query = query.filter(
            User.created_at.between(filters["registration_date_start"], filters["registration_date_end"])
        )

    # Add pagination
    query = query.offset(skip).limit(limit)

    # Execute the query and count total users
    result = await session.execute(query)
    users = result.scalars().all()

    total_query = select(func.count()).select_from(User)
    total_result = await session.execute(total_query)
    total_users = total_result.scalar()

    return users, total_users
```

## Tests           
Covered by service layer tests in tests/test_service/test_user_service.py.        



3. # Schemas (user_schemas.py)          
## Title:         
Define Request Validation Model.             

## Description           
This section introduces the UserSearchParams schema to validate the query parameters sent to the /users endpoint.              

## Expected Outcome          
The schema should:           
1. Ensure that all query parameters adhere to the expected data types.       
2. Provide example values for API documentation purposes.          

## Resolution Steps            
- Defined the UserSearchParams model using Pydantic.              
- Included fields for username, email, role, account_status, and date range.               

Purpose: Define the models for query parameters and response structure.         

```python
class UserSearchParams(BaseModel):
    username: Optional[str] = Field(None, example="john_doe")
    email: Optional[EmailStr] = Field(None, example="john.doe@example.com")
    role: Optional[UserRole] = Field(None, example="ADMIN")
    account_status: Optional[bool] = Field(None, example=True)
    registration_date_start: Optional[datetime] = Field(None, example="2023-01-01T00:00:00Z")
    registration_date_end: Optional[datetime] = Field(None, example="2023-12-31T23:59:59Z")
```

from urllib.parse import urlencode


def generate_pagination_links(
    request: Any, skip: int, limit: int, total_items: int
) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """
    Generate pagination links for API responses.
    """
    base_url = str(request.url).split("?")[0]
    query_params = dict(request.query_params)

    # Calculate the next page link
    if skip + limit < total_items:
        query_params["skip"] = skip + limit
        query_params["limit"] = limit
        next_link = f"{base_url}?{urlencode(query_params)}"
    else:
        next_link = None

    # Calculate the previous page link
    if skip - limit >= 0:
        query_params["skip"] = max(skip - limit, 0)
        query_params["limit"] = limit
        prev_link = f"{base_url}?{urlencode(query_params)}"
    else:
        prev_link = None

    # Calculate the first and last page links
    query_params["skip"] = 0
    first_link = f"{base_url}?{urlencode(query_params)}"

    last_page_skip = (total_items - 1) // limit * limit
    query_params["skip"] = last_page_skip
    last_link = f"{base_url}?{urlencode(query_params)}"

    return {
        "next": next_link,
        "prev": prev_link,
        "first": first_link,
        "last": last_link,
    }
```

Purpose: Set up data for testing.          

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
async def users_with_same_role_50_users(db_session: AsyncSession):
    users = []
    for i in range(50):
        user_data = {
            "nickname": f"user_{i}",
            "email": f"user{i}@example.com",
            "role": "ADMIN",
        }
        user = User(**user_data)
        db_session.add(user)
        users.append(user)
    await db_session.commit()
    return users
```

Verify Case-Insensitive Filtering of Users       
- Description       
The purpose of this test is to ensure that the user search and filtering functionality works correctly regardless of the case of the input provided. User data in the database might have mixed-case values, but administrators or users should be able to search for them without worrying about capitalization. This test verifies that the filtering mechanism is case-insensitive for key fields such as usernames, emails, and roles.       
- Expected Outcome:       
The system should match and return user data even when the case of the search query does not exactly match the case stored in the database.          
- Test Scenario:       
1. A database is preloaded with mock user data that includes usernames, emails, and roles in mixed cases.         
2. The test performs searches using different cases (e.g., all lowercase, all uppercase, mixed case) for:       
- Usernames      
- Emails       
- Roles         
The test validates that the correct user records are returned regardless of the case of the search query.       
- Test Steps:        
- Define filters with varying cases for username, email, and role.          
- Call the search_and_filter_users service with these filters.          
- Assert that the returned results match the expected users, confirming case-insensitive behavior.            

- Results:         
- If the test passes, it confirms that the filtering logic is case-insensitive.       
- If the test fails, it indicates that the service or database query needs to be updated to handle case-insensitive comparisons correctly.              

- Why It‚Äôs Important:           
 This test ensures that the application is user-friendly and robust. Users might not always input the exact case when searching for data, and failing to account for this could result in missed results or user frustration. Implementing and validating case-insensitivity improves usability and avoids such pitfalls.        

 12. # test_fetch_all_users       
 - purpose:

- The API should return a list of users with proper pagination when no filters are applied.        
- The response should include the total count of users and an array of user items.      
- Test Scenario:          
1. The test sends a GET request to the /users endpoint without any filters, specifying only basic pagination parameters (skip and limit).        
2. It verifies that the response:        
- Has a status code of 200 OK.        
- Contains a key called items representing the list of users.          
- Contains a key called total representing the total number of users in the system.      
- Ensures that items is a list.        
- Test Steps:         
1. Set up the required authorization headers using an admin token.          
2. Specify basic pagination parameters (skip and limit).           
3. Send a GET request to the /users endpoint with these parameters.         
3. Validate the response by asserting:
The status code is 200.          
4. The response includes the items key, and it contains a list.            
5. The total key exists and is a non-negative integer.         
- Results:          
If the test passes:         
- It confirms that the /users endpoint     correctly handles requests without filters.      
- It ensures that the response includes essential data such as the list of users and the total user count.         
If the test fails:      
- It indicates an issue with the endpoint's ability to fetch unfiltered user data or manage pagination.                 
- Why It‚Äôs Important:            
 This test validates the core functionality of the /users endpoint. Being able to fetch all users without filters is a fundamental feature that administrators rely on for user management. Ensuring the API can handle this scenario correctly, including providing accurate pagination details, is critical for usability and reliability.         

 13. # test_pagination_edge_cases      
 - purpose:        
 Verify Pagination Utility Handles Edge Cases        
 - Description:          
  This test ensures that the pagination utility (generate_pagination_links) handles edge cases correctly. It validates the behavior of pagination links under specific conditions, ensuring the utility functions as expected in less common scenarios.      
  - Expected Outcome:             
1. The utility should correctly calculate pagination links when the total number of items is less than the specified limit.       
2. The utility should generate correct links when the total number of items is an exact multiple of the limit.               
- Test Scenario:           
1. Case 1: Total items are fewer than the pagination limit.            
- There should be no "next" or "previous" links because all items fit on the first page.           
2. Case 2: Total items are an exact multiple of the pagination limit.              
- The "last" link should correctly point to the last page, ensuring accurate boundary handling.          
- Test Steps:          
 1. Setup: Create a mock request object simulating the API's base URL and query parameters.                  
2. Case 1:
- Generate pagination links with a total number of items less than the limit.       
- Verify that "next" and "prev" links are None.                
3. Case 2:
- Generate pagination links with the total number of items being a multiple of the limit.           
- Verify that the "last" link points to the last page with the correct skip and limit parameters.       
- Results:        
If the test passes:        
It confirms that the pagination utility correctly handles edge cases, ensuring accurate and reliable pagination links.      
If the test fails:          
It indicates issues in the pagination utility, particularly in handling edge scenarios like small datasets or perfectly divisible totals.        
- Why It‚Äôs Important:           
Pagination is essential for efficiently navigating large datasets. Edge cases like small datasets or exact multiples of the limit can expose hidden bugs in the pagination logic. This test ensures the utility can handle such scenarios gracefully, providing a consistent user experience.     

14. # test_search_users_pagination       
- purpose:      
 Verifies that the API correctly applies pagination when fetching users.       
 - Description:          
1. This test validates the proper implementation of pagination functionality in the /users API endpoint. It ensures that:           
- The endpoint correctly returns a subset of users based on the skip and limit parameters.        
- The pagination system is working as expected by retrieving different pages of results.       
- Steps Taken:       
1. Headers Setup: The test sets up the Authorization headers with an admin token to access the endpoint.             
2. First Page Test:          
- It sends a request to fetch the first page of users with a skip of 0 and a limit of 5.        
- The test validates that the response returns exactly 5 users and that these users are in the expected range.         
- Second Page Test:         
It sends another request to fetch the next page with a skip of 5 and the same limit of 5.           
The test ensures that the results are different from the first page and validates the count.          
- Expected Outcomes:           
1. The /users endpoint returns users in chunks based on the skip and limit values.      
- The total number of items in the first page matches the limit.         
- The second page results do not overlap with the first page.            
- The test ensures the total key in the response correctly reflects the total count of users in the database.           
- What This Test Verifies:         
1. The endpoint handles skip and limit parameters correctly.         
2. Pagination works seamlessly and doesn't repeat or omit records between pages.         
3. The API provides accurate metadata about the total number of users.
