# Issue: Implement Robust Username Generation and Validation for Enhanced User Management            

## Description:
This section of the project implements robust username management features designed to enhance user experience and ensure data integrity. The implementation supports the automatic generation of unique, URL-safe nicknames for users during creation while allowing users to change their nicknames with validation. It enforces strict uniqueness and format constraints, ensuring compatibility with public-facing identifiers. This functionality improves user anonymity and privacy by assigning meaningful, anonymous nicknames based on a combination of words and numbers.            

## Features:
1. Username Generation:          

- Randomly generate nicknames upon user creation.              
- Use a combination of nouns, verbs, and a numeric suffix to ensure meaningful and diverse names.                  

2. Nickname Uniqueness:              
- Validate that no two users share the same nickname.               
- Handle duplicate nickname conflicts during both user creation and updates.
                    
3. URL-Safe Identifier:                  
- Ensure that nicknames are URL-safe, allowing them to be used in public contexts without encoding issues.                      
- Only allow alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens in nicknames.
                          
4. User-Controlled Updates:               
- Allow users to update their nicknames, ensuring the new nickname is both valid and unique.           

5. Privacy and Anonymity:                        
- Assign anonymous nicknames by default to protect user identities.          
- Maintain privacy by validating nicknames against strict rules.          

6. Testing and Verification:                       
- The system includes comprehensive tests to ensure correctness, with plans for additional tests to cover edge cases and rare scenarios.          

## Expected Outcome                
- Users will always have unique nicknames, either system-generated or user-updated.                        
- Nicknames will be compliant with URL-safety standards, ensuring seamless usage in public links.                     
- Conflicts arising from duplicate nicknames during creation or updates will be handled gracefully.                    
- User privacy and anonymity will be safeguarded through anonymous nickname assignments.                       

## Resolution Steps

1. # Routes (user_routes.py)      
## Title:               
Define the Search and Filtering Endpoint.           

## Description:        
This section adds a new /users endpoint in the user_routes.py file. The endpoint accepts query parameters to filter users based on specified criteria.                

## Expected outcome:          
The /users endpoint should:              
1. Accept query parameters like username, email, role, account_status, and date range.                  
2. Return filtered results as a paginated response.            

## Resolution Steps:        
- Added the /users endpoint with the necessary query parameters.            
- Integrated the UserService.search_and_filter_users method for filtering.         
- Included generate_pagination_links to support paginated responses.         

Purpose: Define the API endpoint for search and filtering functionality.        

```python 
@router.get("/users", response_model=UserListResponse, tags=["User Management Requires (Admin or Manager Roles)"])
async def search_users(
    request: Request,
    username: Optional[str] = None,
    email: Optional[str] = None,
    role: Optional[str] = None,
    account_status: Optional[bool] = None,
    registration_date_start: Optional[datetime] = None,
    registration_date_end: Optional[datetime] = None,
    skip: int = 0,
    limit: int = 10,
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: dict = Depends(require_role(["ADMIN", "MANAGER"]))
):
    """
    Endpoint to search and filter users based on various criteria.
    """
    filters = {
        "username": username,
        "email": email,
        "role": role,
        "account_status": account_status,
        "registration_date_start": registration_date_start,
        "registration_date_end": registration_date_end,
    }
    users, total_users = await UserService.search_and_filter_users(db, filters, skip, limit)
    user_responses = [UserResponse.model_validate(user) for user in users]
    pagination_links = generate_pagination_links(request, skip, limit, total_users)

    return UserListResponse(
        items=user_responses,
        total=total_users,
        page=skip // limit + 1,
        size=len(user_responses),
        links=pagination_links
    )
```
## Tests:      
Covered by API tests in tests/test_api/test_users_api.py.



2. # Service Layer (user_service.py)
## Title:       
Implement Filtering Logic.         

## Description         
This section defines the logic for filtering users based on criteria provided via the API. It interacts with the database and applies filters dynamically.           

## Expected Outcome          
The UserService.search_and_filter_users method should:

1. Apply all filters, including username, email, role, account status, and date range.             
2. Return paginated results along with the total count of users.            

## Resolution Steps          
- Implemented dynamic filtering using SQLAlchemy's query-building capabilities.               
- Added support for pagination using offset and limit.           
- Handled edge cases, such as missing or invalid filter values.           

Purpose: Add the logic to perform filtering and querying of users from the database.          

```python
@staticmethod
async def search_and_filter_users(
    session: AsyncSession, 
    filters: Dict[str, Optional[str]], 
    skip: int, 
    limit: int
) -> Tuple[List[User], int]:
    """
    Search and filter users based on the given criteria.
    """
    query = select(User)

    # Apply filters
    if filters.get("username"):
        query = query.filter(User.nickname.ilike(f"%{filters['username']}%"))
    if filters.get("email"):
        query = query.filter(User.email.ilike(f"%{filters['email']}%"))
    if filters.get("role"):
        query = query.filter(User.role == filters["role"])
    if filters.get("account_status") is not None:
        query = query.filter(User.email_verified == filters["account_status"])
    if filters.get("registration_date_start") and filters.get("registration_date_end"):
        query = query.filter(
            User.created_at.between(filters["registration_date_start"], filters["registration_date_end"])
        )

    # Add pagination
    query = query.offset(skip).limit(limit)

    # Execute the query and count total users
    result = await session.execute(query)
    users = result.scalars().all()

    total_query = select(func.count()).select_from(User)
    total_result = await session.execute(total_query)
    total_users = total_result.scalar()

    return users, total_users
```

## Tests           
Covered by service layer tests in tests/test_service/test_user_service.py.        



3. # Schemas (user_schemas.py)          
## Title:         
Define Request Validation Model.             

## Description           
This section introduces the UserSearchParams schema to validate the query parameters sent to the /users endpoint.              

## Expected Outcome          
The schema should:           
1. Ensure that all query parameters adhere to the expected data types.       
2. Provide example values for API documentation purposes.          

## Resolution Steps            
- Defined the UserSearchParams model using Pydantic.              
- Included fields for username, email, role, account_status, and date range.               

Purpose: Define the models for query parameters and response structure.         

```python
class UserSearchParams(BaseModel):
    username: Optional[str] = Field(None, example="john_doe")
    email: Optional[EmailStr] = Field(None, example="john.doe@example.com")
    role: Optional[UserRole] = Field(None, example="ADMIN")
    account_status: Optional[bool] = Field(None, example=True)
    registration_date_start: Optional[datetime] = Field(None, example="2023-01-01T00:00:00Z")
    registration_date_end: Optional[datetime] = Field(None, example="2023-12-31T23:59:59Z")
```

from urllib.parse import urlencode


def generate_pagination_links(
    request: Any, skip: int, limit: int, total_items: int
) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """
    Generate pagination links for API responses.
    """
    base_url = str(request.url).split("?")[0]
    query_params = dict(request.query_params)

    # Calculate the next page link
    if skip + limit < total_items:
        query_params["skip"] = skip + limit
        query_params["limit"] = limit
        next_link = f"{base_url}?{urlencode(query_params)}"
    else:
        next_link = None

    # Calculate the previous page link
    if skip - limit >= 0:
        query_params["skip"] = max(skip - limit, 0)
        query_params["limit"] = limit
        prev_link = f"{base_url}?{urlencode(query_params)}"
    else:
        prev_link = None

    # Calculate the first and last page links
    query_params["skip"] = 0
    first_link = f"{base_url}?{urlencode(query_params)}"

    last_page_skip = (total_items - 1) // limit * limit
    query_params["skip"] = last_page_skip
    last_link = f"{base_url}?{urlencode(query_params)}"

    return {
        "next": next_link,
        "prev": prev_link,
        "first": first_link,
        "last": last_link,
    }
```

## Expected Outcome         
The fixture should:              
1. Create a predefined set of mock users.             
2. Ensure that the test environment has consistent data.              

## Resolution Steps             
- Defined a fixture to create 50 mock users with the same role.           
- Committed the data to the database session.          

Purpose: Set up data for testing.          

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
async def users_with_same_role_50_users(db_session: AsyncSession):
    users = []
    for i in range(50):
        user_data = {
            "nickname": f"user_{i}",
            "email": f"user{i}@example.com",
            "role": "ADMIN",
        }
        user = User(**user_data)
        db_session.add(user)
        users.append(user)
    await db_session.commit()
    return users
```
## Tests
Used by service layer tests in tests/test_service/test_user_service.py.       

## Conclusion
The above updates comprehensively implement the feature, meeting all requirements. The code now supports search and filtering by multiple criteria, provides paginated responses, and includes extensive tests to ensure reliability.
