# ISSUE: Fix Docker Build Error Related to libc-bin Version Constraint    
## Description:    
The Docker Compose build process failed due to a version constraint on the libc-bin package in the Dockerfile. Specifically, the issue occurred because the specified version of libc-bin conflicted with the system requirements, causing a downgrade without using the --allow-downgrades flag. This led to build errors when running:         
```python
docker compose up --build
```
## Root Cause:         
- The Dockerfile included a hardcoded version constraint for libc-bin (2.36-9+deb12u7).         
- Docker's package management system could not reconcile the specific version during installation.           
- Running without --allow-downgrades caused the build to fail.        

## Key Features of the Fix:          
1. Removal of Specific libc-bin Version Constraint         
- The hardcoded version libc-bin=2.36-9+deb12u7 was removed to allow the latest version of libc-bin to install seamlessly.              

2. Consolidation of Installation Commands         
- Installation of system dependencies and cleanup steps were optimized into a single RUN command, improving efficiency and readability.    

3. Improved Dockerfile Comments            
- Updated comments to ensure clarity about the purpose of each section, aligning with best practices.           

## Benifits:

- Future Compatibility: Avoiding a specific version ensures the latest compatible libc-bin version is installed, reducing maintenance overhead.       
- Efficiency: Combining installation commands reduces the number of layers in the Docker image, improving performance and image size.        

## Expected Outcome:      
Users can run the following command to build and run the application successfully:      
```python
docker compose up --build
```
## Files Updated:      
1. Dockerfile         
- Removed the specific version constraint for libc-bin.            
- Combined installation commands for system dependencies and cleanup.          
- Improved inline comments to explain the changes.

# IISUE: Password Validation and Security Enhancements     
## Enhancement:                  
To ensure the highest level of security for user accounts, we have introduced robust password validation mechanisms. These updates are designed to align with industry standards for secure password practices, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and protecting user data.          

## Key Features of Password Validation           
1. Minimum Length Requirement              
Passwords must be sufficiently long to enhance resistance to brute-force attacks. A password must contain at least 8 characters to be accepted.             
2. Complexity Requirements          
To ensure passwords are not easily guessable, they must include a mix of different character types:           
- Uppercase Letters: At least one uppercase letter (e.g., A-Z) to strengthen the password.            
- Lowercase Letters: At least one lowercase letter (e.g., a-z) to improve complexity.             
- Numbers: At least one numeric character (e.g., 0-9) is required.           
- Special Characters: To add further complexity, the password must include at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*()_+-=<>?).             
3. Restrictions on Spaces               
Passwords should not contain whitespace characters to maintain consistency and avoid unexpected formatting issues during user input.                
4. Secure Password Storage                
Passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database using modern cryptographic algorithms. This ensures that even in the unlikely event of a data breach, user passwords remain protected.

2. All subsequent users will have the default role AUTHENTICATED, unless explicitly updated later.          
3. Role assignment logic is encapsulated within the UserService.create method, ensuring consistent behavior across all user creation pathways.      
4. Updated unit tests validate this behavior, guaranteeing that the logic works as expected during all edge cases.             

## Files Updated for Implementing This Issue          
1. user_service.py           
- Added logic in the UserService.create method to check if the user is the first in the database using the is_first_user method.          
- Updated role assignment logic to assign ADMIN to the first user.          
2. user_model.py          
- Ensured the role column uses an Enum to define roles (ADMIN and AUTHENTICATED) with a default value of AUTHENTICATED.             
3. test_user_service.py          
- Added/Updated tests to validate the following scenarios:
   - The first user is assigned the ADMIN role.         
   - All subsequent users are assigned the AUTHENTICATED role

# IISUE: Ensure Admin User Exists and Streamline /login Authentication Logic     

## Enhancement:       
The /login logic in user_routes.py was repeated multiple times, making the code redundant and harder to maintain. Additionally, authenticating as an admin user through Swagger (using the Authorize button) was not functioning as expected. This issue ensures the admin user (admin@example.com) is dynamically seeded into the database during migrations or tests, reducing code duplication and enabling secure and consistent authentication.           

## Benefits         
- Test Reliability: Ensures that tests for the /login endpoint consistently pass by dynamically creating the required admin user during test setup or database migrations.            
- Streamlined Logic: Removes redundancy in the /login logic, making the code more maintainable and easier to extend.           
- Secure API Testing: Allows successful admin authentication in Swagger, enhancing the ability to test and use the API securely.            
- Improved Accuracy: Reflects real-world scenarios for authenticating users via the /login endpoint, including robust password validation.           

## Expected Outcome         
- Swagger Authorization: Admin users should successfully authenticate using the Swagger Authorize button, improving the API testing experience.      
- Login Endpoint: The /login endpoint will securely and consistently handle authentication without redundant code.          
- Test Success: Tests for the /login endpoint, including test_login_success, will succeed and reliably validate endpoint behavior.           

## Files Updated for Implementing This Issue          
1. user_routes.py:           
- Refactored /login logic to eliminate redundancy while maintaining secure and consistent authentication.            

2. tests/test_routes/test_user_routes.py:        
- Updated the test_login_success test to ensure the admin user (admin@example.com) is fetched dynamically from the database and authenticated securely.             

3. alembic/versions/25d814bc83ed_initial_migration.py:            
- Modified the Alembic migration to seed the admin@example.com user during database migrations, ensuring it exists for both development and test environments.               
4. conftest.py:               
- Verified and maintained fixtures to support dynamic seeding of the admin user during test execution.

## Implementation Summary         
This update addresses challenges in the /login logic, improves the Swagger authentication experience, and ensures all tests for the endpoint pass by dynamically seeding the admin user during migrations or tests. This streamlining of logic reduces redundancy and enhances the maintainability of the codebase.

# FEATURE: Search and Filtering Capabilities for User Management           
## Description:        
This feature allows administrators to search and filter users based on various criteria, such as username, email, role, account status (locked/unlocked), and registration date range. The system supports both basic search using query parameters and advanced search using dynamic JSON filters. Results are paginated for efficient navigation, and dynamic pagination links (next, prev, first, last) are provided to enhance usability.           

The implementation adheres to RESTful principles and offers clean, discoverable API responses. It also lays the groundwork for future enhancements like full-text search using ElasticSearch and user-friendly frontend integration.                         

## User Story:       
As an administrator, I want to be able to:           

1. Search for users by username, email, or role.          
2. Filter users based on account status or registration date range.        
3. Navigate through filtered results using pagination.       
4. Perform advanced searches with multiple dynamic filters for flexibility.       


## Viable Features:        
1. Search Functionality: Search for users using username, email, and role.         
2. Filtering Options: Filter users based on account status and registration date range.    
3. Advanced Search: Allow dynamic filter combinations with JSON input.        
4. Pagination: Integrate offset-based pagination with navigation links (next, prev, first, last).        
5. Clean API Responses: Return user-friendly and discoverable API responses.           

1. # Routes (user_routes.py)      
## Title:               
Define the Search and Filtering Endpoint.           

## Description:        
Two endpoints are introduced in user_routes.py for user search and filtering:
1. /users-basic (GET): Supports simple searches using query parameters.           
2. /users-advanced (POST): Provides advanced search capabilities by accepting a JSON request body for multiple filters.              
These endpoints leverage schemas for input validation, dynamic filtering logic, and pagination utilities to return efficient and clean responses.        

## Expected outcome:          
1. Basic Search (/users-basic):         
- Accepts query parameters like username, email, role, is_locked, and pagination (skip, limit).    
- Returns paginated user data with dynamic pagination links.         

2. Advanced Search (/users-advanced):         
- Accepts a JSON body with filters: created_from, created_to, role, is_locked, etc.       
- Dynamically applies multiple filters to query users efficiently.                  
- Returns paginated results with metadata and the original filters for clarity.                

## Resolution Steps:        
- Added the /users endpoint with the necessary query parameters.            
- Integrated the UserService.search_and_filter_users method for filtering.         
- Included generate_pagination_links to support paginated responses.         

Purpose: Define the API endpoint for search and filtering functionality.        

```python 
@router.get("/users", response_model=UserListResponse, tags=["User Management Requires (Admin or Manager Roles)"])
async def search_users(
    request: Request,
    username: Optional[str] = None,
    email: Optional[str] = None,
    role: Optional[str] = None,
    account_status: Optional[bool] = None,
    registration_date_start: Optional[datetime] = None,
    registration_date_end: Optional[datetime] = None,
    skip: int = 0,
    limit: int = 10,
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: dict = Depends(require_role(["ADMIN", "MANAGER"]))
):
    """
    Endpoint to search and filter users based on various criteria.
    """
    filters = {
        "username": username,
        "email": email,
        "role": role,
        "account_status": account_status,
        "registration_date_start": registration_date_start,
        "registration_date_end": registration_date_end,
    }
    users, total_users = await UserService.search_and_filter_users(db, filters, skip, limit)
    user_responses = [UserResponse.model_validate(user) for user in users]
    pagination_links = generate_pagination_links(request, skip, limit, total_users)

    return UserListResponse(
        items=user_responses,
        total=total_users,
        page=skip // limit + 1,
        size=len(user_responses),
        links=pagination_links
    )
```
## Tests:      
Covered by API tests in tests/test_api/test_users_api.py.



2. # Service Layer (user_service.py)
## Title:       
Implement Filtering Logic.         

## Description         
This section defines the logic for filtering users based on criteria provided via the API. It interacts with the database and applies filters dynamically.           

## Expected Outcome          
The UserService.search_and_filter_users method should:

1. Apply all filters, including username, email, role, account status, and date range.             
2. Return paginated results along with the total count of users.            

## Resolution Steps          
- Implemented dynamic filtering using SQLAlchemy's query-building capabilities.               
- Added support for pagination using offset and limit.           
- Handled edge cases, such as missing or invalid filter values.           

Purpose: Add the logic to perform filtering and querying of users from the database.          

```python
@staticmethod
async def search_and_filter_users(
    session: AsyncSession, 
    filters: Dict[str, Optional[str]], 
    skip: int, 
    limit: int
) -> Tuple[List[User], int]:
    """
    Search and filter users based on the given criteria.
    """
    query = select(User)

    # Apply filters
    if filters.get("username"):
        query = query.filter(User.nickname.ilike(f"%{filters['username']}%"))
    if filters.get("email"):
        query = query.filter(User.email.ilike(f"%{filters['email']}%"))
    if filters.get("role"):
        query = query.filter(User.role == filters["role"])
    if filters.get("account_status") is not None:
        query = query.filter(User.email_verified == filters["account_status"])
    if filters.get("registration_date_start") and filters.get("registration_date_end"):
        query = query.filter(
            User.created_at.between(filters["registration_date_start"], filters["registration_date_end"])
        )

    # Add pagination
    query = query.offset(skip).limit(limit)

    # Execute the query and count total users
    result = await session.execute(query)
    users = result.scalars().all()

    total_query = select(func.count()).select_from(User)
    total_result = await session.execute(total_query)
    total_users = total_result.scalar()

    return users, total_users
```

## Tests           
Covered by service layer tests in tests/test_service/test_user_service.py.

This section introduces the UserSearchParams schema to validate the query parameters sent to the /users endpoint.              

## Expected Outcome          
The schema should:           
1. Ensure that all query parameters adhere to the expected data types.       
2. Provide example values for API documentation purposes.          

## Resolution Steps            
- Defined the UserSearchParams model using Pydantic.              
- Included fields for username, email, role, account_status, and date range.               

Purpose: Define the models for query parameters and response structure.         

```python
class UserSearchParams(BaseModel):
    username: Optional[str] = Field(None, example="john_doe")
    email: Optional[EmailStr] = Field(None, example="john.doe@example.com")
    role: Optional[UserRole] = Field(None, example="ADMIN")
    account_status: Optional[bool] = Field(None, example=True)
    registration_date_start: Optional[datetime] = Field(None, example="2023-01-01T00:00:00Z")
    registration_date_end: Optional[datetime] = Field(None, example="2023-12-31T23:59:59Z")
```

) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """
    Generate pagination links for API responses.
    """
    base_url = str(request.url).split("?")[0]
    query_params = dict(request.query_params)

    # Calculate the next page link
    if skip + limit < total_items:
        query_params["skip"] = skip + limit
        query_params["limit"] = limit
        next_link = f"{base_url}?{urlencode(query_params)}"
    else:
        next_link = None

    # Calculate the previous page link
    if skip - limit >= 0:
        query_params["skip"] = max(skip - limit, 0)
        query_params["limit"] = limit
        prev_link = f"{base_url}?{urlencode(query_params)}"
    else:
        prev_link = None

    # Calculate the first and last page links
    query_params["skip"] = 0
    first_link = f"{base_url}?{urlencode(query_params)}"

    last_page_skip = (total_items - 1) // limit * limit
    query_params["skip"] = last_page_skip
    last_link = f"{base_url}?{urlencode(query_params)}"

    return {
        "next": next_link,
        "prev": prev_link,
        "first": first_link,
        "last": last_link,
    }

Verify Case-Insensitive Filtering of Users       
- Description       
The purpose of this test is to ensure that the user search and filtering functionality works correctly regardless of the case of the input provided. User data in the database might have mixed-case values, but administrators or users should be able to search for them without worrying about capitalization. This test verifies that the filtering mechanism is case-insensitive for key fields such as usernames, emails, and roles.       
- Expected Outcome:       
The system should match and return user data even when the case of the search query does not exactly match the case stored in the database.          
- Test Scenario:       
1. A database is preloaded with mock user data that includes usernames, emails, and roles in mixed cases.         
2. The test performs searches using different cases (e.g., all lowercase, all uppercase, mixed case) for:       
- Usernames      
- Emails       
- Roles         
The test validates that the correct user records are returned regardless of the case of the search query.       
- Test Steps:        
- Define filters with varying cases for username, email, and role.          
- Call the search_and_filter_users service with these filters.          
- Assert that the returned results match the expected users, confirming case-insensitive behavior.            

- Results:         
- If the test passes, it confirms that the filtering logic is case-insensitive.       
- If the test fails, it indicates that the service or database query needs to be updated to handle case-insensitive comparisons correctly.              

- Why It‚Äôs Important:           
 This test ensures that the application is user-friendly and robust. Users might not always input the exact case when searching for data, and failing to account for this could result in missed results or user frustration. Implementing and validating case-insensitivity improves usability and avoids such pitfalls.        

 12. # test_fetch_all_users       
 - purpose:

 - Expected Outcome:       
- The API should return a list of users with proper pagination when no filters are applied.        
- The response should include the total count of users and an array of user items.      
- Test Scenario:          
1. The test sends a GET request to the /users endpoint without any filters, specifying only basic pagination parameters (skip and limit).        
2. It verifies that the response:        
- Has a status code of 200 OK.        
- Contains a key called items representing the list of users.          
- Contains a key called total representing the total number of users in the system.      
- Ensures that items is a list.        
- Test Steps:         
1. Set up the required authorization headers using an admin token.          
2. Specify basic pagination parameters (skip and limit).           
3. Send a GET request to the /users endpoint with these parameters.         
3. Validate the response by asserting:
The status code is 200.          
4. The response includes the items key, and it contains a list.            
5. The total key exists and is a non-negative integer.         
- Results:          
If the test passes:         
- It confirms that the /users endpoint     correctly handles requests without filters.      
- It ensures that the response includes essential data such as the list of users and the total user count.         
If the test fails:      
- It indicates an issue with the endpoint's ability to fetch unfiltered user data or manage pagination.                 
- Why It‚Äôs Important:            
 This test validates the core functionality of the /users endpoint. Being able to fetch all users without filters is a fundamental feature that administrators rely on for user management. Ensuring the API can handle this scenario correctly, including providing accurate pagination details, is critical for usability and reliability.         

 13. # test_pagination_edge_cases      
 - purpose:        
 Verify Pagination Utility Handles Edge Cases        
 - Description:          
  This test ensures that the pagination utility (generate_pagination_links) handles edge cases correctly. It validates the behavior of pagination links under specific conditions, ensuring the utility functions as expected in less common scenarios.      
  - Expected Outcome:             
1. The utility should correctly calculate pagination links when the total number of items is less than the specified limit.       
2. The utility should generate correct links when the total number of items is an exact multiple of the limit.               
- Test Scenario:           
1. Case 1: Total items are fewer than the pagination limit.            
- There should be no "next" or "previous" links because all items fit on the first page.           
2. Case 2: Total items are an exact multiple of the pagination limit.              
- The "last" link should correctly point to the last page, ensuring accurate boundary handling.          
- Test Steps:          
 1. Setup: Create a mock request object simulating the API's base URL and query parameters.                  
2. Case 1:
- Generate pagination links with a total number of items less than the limit.       
- Verify that "next" and "prev" links are None.                
3. Case 2:
- Generate pagination links with the total number of items being a multiple of the limit.           
- Verify that the "last" link points to the last page with the correct skip and limit parameters.       
- Results:        
If the test passes:        
It confirms that the pagination utility correctly handles edge cases, ensuring accurate and reliable pagination links.      
If the test fails:          
It indicates issues in the pagination utility, particularly in handling edge scenarios like small datasets or perfectly divisible totals.        
- Why It‚Äôs Important:           
Pagination is essential for efficiently navigating large datasets. Edge cases like small datasets or exact multiples of the limit can expose hidden bugs in the pagination logic. This test ensures the utility can handle such scenarios gracefully, providing a consistent user experience.     

14. # test_search_users_pagination       
- purpose:      
 Verifies that the API correctly applies pagination when fetching users.       
 - Description:          
1. This test validates the proper implementation of pagination functionality in the /users API endpoint. It ensures that:           
- The endpoint correctly returns a subset of users based on the skip and limit parameters.        
- The pagination system is working as expected by retrieving different pages of results.       
- Steps Taken:       
1. Headers Setup: The test sets up the Authorization headers with an admin token to access the endpoint.             
2. First Page Test:          
- It sends a request to fetch the first page of users with a skip of 0 and a limit of 5.        
- The test validates that the response returns exactly 5 users and that these users are in the expected range.         
- Second Page Test:         
It sends another request to fetch the next page with a skip of 5 and the same limit of 5.           
The test ensures that the results are different from the first page and validates the count.          
- Expected Outcomes:           
1. The /users endpoint returns users in chunks based on the skip and limit values.      
- The total number of items in the first page matches the limit.         
- The second page results do not overlap with the first page.            
- The test ensures the total key in the response correctly reflects the total count of users in the database.           
- What This Test Verifies:         
1. The endpoint handles skip and limit parameters correctly.         
2. Pagination works seamlessly and doesn't repeat or omit records between pages.         
3. The API provides accurate metadata about the total number of users.
